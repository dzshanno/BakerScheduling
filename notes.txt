Features for the Bakers' Scheduling Web App
User Authentication:

Login System: Allow bakers to create accounts and log in securely.
Role Management: Assign roles (e.g., trainee, trained, trainer) to help the business manager view schedules at different experience levels.
Shift Scheduling:

Calendar Interface: Display available shifts (e.g., Wednesday-Saturday) so bakers can sign up for slots.
Role Requirements: Indicate how many trainees, trainers, or trained people are needed for each shift.
Shift Requests: Allow bakers to request to work specific shifts, which can then be approved by the business manager.
Business Manager Dashboard:

View Shift Status: The business manager can see who has signed up for each shift and whether the team is fully staffed.
Add/Edit Shifts: Ability to add extra shifts, edit existing ones, or fill gaps as needed.
Notifications: Notify bakers about unfilled shifts or shift changes, ensuring enough staff coverage.
Notification System:

Automatic Alerts: Email or SMS notifications to bakers when shifts are added, confirmed, or changed.
Reminders: Automated reminders for upcoming shifts.
Technical Implementation
Tools and Frameworks to Use:
Backend:

Python with Flask or Django: These frameworks are both well-suited for managing authentication, backend logic, and integration with a database.
Database: Use SQLite (for small scale) or PostgreSQL/MySQL for scalability. This will store user data, shifts, and roles.
Frontend:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For a responsive and easy-to-use interface.
React or Vue.js (optional): To add more interactive elements, making the scheduling interface more user-friendly.
Hosting:

Heroku or Render: Good options for hosting your app with minimal hassle.
Firebase: Can also be considered for hosting if you want an easy integration with other Google services.
Authentication:

Flask-Login or Django Auth: To manage user authentication.
OAuth: Integration with Google or other OAuth providers for simplified user sign-up and sign-in.
Basic Architecture
Home Page:

Overview of upcoming shifts, and a button to log in or sign up.
User Dashboard:

View Shifts: Users can see available shifts and the status of their signed-up shifts.
Sign Up for Shifts: Select specific shifts to sign up for based on availability.
Admin Dashboard (Business Manager):

Shift Overview: A calendar-style view of shifts, indicating how many bakers are signed up and what roles are covered.
Add/Edit Shifts: A form to add new shifts or edit current ones.
Approve/Reject Shifts: Manage which bakers are assigned to shifts.


Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
Design the Database:

Users Table: Stores user data (username, password, role).
Shifts Table: Stores information about each shift (date, time, number of slots available).
Shift Signups Table: Stores relationships between users and shifts (who signed up for what).
Build the Backend:

Set up models for users, shifts, and shift signups.
Implement authentication (using Djangoâ€™s built-in or Flask-Login).
Create the Frontend:

Develop forms for signing up/logging in.
Use a calendar interface for viewing shifts (a JavaScript library like FullCalendar can be helpful).
Implement a responsive design to ensure it works well on both desktop and mobile.
Integrate Backend and Frontend:

Use API endpoints to link the backend logic with the frontend display, allowing users to sign up for shifts and receive real-time updates.
Testing:

Ensure that users can only sign up for available shifts and that the right number of trainees, trained bakers, and trainers are assigned to each.
Test the business manager dashboard to ensure easy visibility of unfilled shifts.
Deployment:

Host the web app on a platform like Heroku or Render.
Set up domain and security (e.g., HTTPS) for safe usage by all the bakers.
